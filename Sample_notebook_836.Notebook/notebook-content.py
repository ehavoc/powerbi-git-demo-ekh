# # A Data Engineering Starter Kit 
# 
# In this notebook, we will explore the fundamentals of using a lakehouse and Apache Spark for data storage and analysis. We will showcase the process of accessing data from the lakehouse, analyzing it with Spark DataFrames, executing elementary data transformations, and preparing the data for machine learning models. Upon completion of this guide, you will possess a solid comprehension of utilizing a lakehouse for data storage and analysis, as well as be adept at executing routine data engineering tasks using Spark. Let's begin!

# MARKDOWN ********************

# This code loads parquet data into a Spark DataFrame named `df`. The data is loaded from the file path `Files/green_tripdata_2022-08.parquet`. The `display()` function is then used to show the contents of the DataFrame in a tabular format.
# 
# Parquet and Delta are two file formats that can be used to store and manage large datasets in big data environments. Parquet is a columnar storage format that is optimized for reading large data sets efficiently. It achieves this by storing related columns of data together, which allows for more efficient data retrieval when querying the data. Parquet is particularly well-suited for use cases that involve querying large amounts of data, such as data warehousing and business intelligence. The read function of the spark object is used to read the parquet data into a DataFrame. Once the data is loaded into the DataFrame, it can be used for various data analysis and processing tasks. The `display()` function is a built-in function that displays the contents of a DataFrame in a tabular format.
# 
# Delta, on the other hand, is a file format that is designed for managing large-scale datasets in distributed environments. Delta is built on top of Parquet, but it also includes additional features that are specifically designed to support transactional processing and other data management tasks. These features include support for ACID transactions, automatic file and partition management, and the ability to merge data updates and deletes.

# MARKDOWN ********************

# The code snippet above demonstrates how to write a Spark DataFrame to a Delta Lake table. Delta Lake provides a layer of reliability and performance enhancements on top of raw data in Parquet format. Compared to raw Parquet files, Delta Lake tables allow for easy versioning, schema evolution, and transactional writes, which is beneficial for scenarios where data is constantly changing and updating. The write function saves the DataFrame as a Delta Lake table, where table_name represents the name of the Delta Lake table, and delta_path represents the file path to store the Delta Lake table. The mode function is used to specify the write mode. In this case, it is set to overwrite, which replaces any existing Delta Lake table with the same name. The format function specifies the format in which the data is written, which in this case is set to Delta Lake format.

# MARKDOWN ********************

# When working with data, one of the initial tasks is to read it into the environment for analysis. Once the data is loaded, basic analysis such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating can be performed. However, as the scale and complexity of the data increase, there is a need for more advanced data engineering scenarios such as data cleansing, transformation, and aggregation. 
# 
# **Congratulations on completing the first part of the sample. Let us now move on to custom scenarios.**

# MARKDOWN ********************

# # Scenario 1: Data cleaning and transformation
# 
# In this scenario, the data engineer could perform some data cleaning and transformation tasks to prepare the data for downstream analysis. For example, they could remove any invalid or missing data, convert the data types of some columns, and add some new calculated columns based on the existing data. This could involve using Spark SQL queries, user-defined functions (UDFs), or built-in Spark functions to manipulate the data.

# MARKDOWN ********************

# Objective: **Cleanse the data and filter out invalid records for further analysis.**

# MARKDOWN ********************

# In this scenario, we aim to demonstrate how data engineers can perform data cleansing and filtering on a large dataset. We begin by loading the data from the source and then filter out records where the trip distance and fare amount are less than or equal to zero, which are invalid records.
# 
# Next, we cleanse the data by converting the `store_and_fwd_flag` column to a boolean type, and converting the `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns to timestamp types. Finally, we write the cleansed data to the destination in the parquet format.
# 
# This scenario demonstrates the importance of data cleansing and filtering to ensure the data is accurate and valid before proceeding with further analysis.

# MARKDOWN ********************

# # Scenario 2: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
# 
# Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a common scenario for data engineers. EDA is the process of analyzing and understanding data to gain insights, identify patterns, and develop hypotheses for further investigation. In data engineering, EDA is often done to identify data quality issues, anomalies, or other problems that need to be addressed before data can be used for analysis or modeling. EDA can also help data engineers to understand the relationships between different data sources and determine the best way to join or transform them.

# MARKDOWN ********************

# `df.count()` is a Spark DataFrame API function that returns the number of rows in the DataFrame. It is a convenient way to quickly determine the size of the DataFrame without having to iterate over all the rows manually. The function is an action in Spark, meaning it triggers a computation that counts the number of rows in the DataFrame and returns the result. It is useful for getting a quick overview of the data size and checking if any rows are missing or dropped during data processing. However, it should be used with caution on large datasets, as it can be a costly operation that requires significant computational resources.

# This code snippet demonstrates how to create a scatter plot using Matplotlib in Python. The code assumes that the Spark DataFrame df contains the columns fare_amount and trip_distance. First, the Spark DataFrame is converted to a Pandas DataFrame using the `toPandas()` function. Then, a scatter plot is created using `ax.scatter()` function. The x and y arguments of the `scatter()` function represent the variables to be plotted on the x- and y-axes, respectively. The alpha argument controls the transparency of the points in the scatter plot. The axis labels and title are set using the `ax.set_xlabel()`, `ax.set_ylabel()`, and `ax.set_title()` functions. Finally, the plot is displayed using the `plt.show()` function. This code can be used to visualize the correlation between fare amount and trip distance in the DataFrame.

# The code first imports all functions from the pyspark.sql.functions module. Next, it creates a DataFrame `df_avg_fare_by_location` by grouping the original DataFrame `df` by the `PULocationID` column and computing the average of the `fare_amount` column for each group, and aliasing the resulting column as `avg_fare_amount`.
# 
# Then, the code reads a CSV file `taxi+_zone_lookup.csv` into a new DataFrame `df_locations` using the spark.read.format method. The options header and load are used to specify that the first row of the CSV file contains the header row and that the file should be loaded into a DataFrame, respectively. The resulting DataFrame `df_locations` contains the columns `LocationID, Borough, Zone, and service_zone`.

# This code joins two Spark DataFrames `df_avg_fare_by_location` and `df_locations` using the join function. The join function combines the rows from both DataFrames based on the matching value of PULocationID column in `df_avg_fare_by_location` and `LocationID` column in `df_locations`.
# 
# The resulting DataFrame `df_avg_fare_by_location_with_names` contains all columns from `df_avg_fare_by_location` and `df_locations` combined into a single DataFrame.
# 
# The `display()` function is used to show the contents of `df_avg_fare_by_location_with_names` in a tabular format.

# # Extract features and label for machine learning modeling
df_ml = df_avg_fare_by_location_with_names.select("avg_fare_amount", "Zone").withColumnRenamed("AVG Fare Amount", "Zone")

# In the code snippet, `df_avg_fare_by_location_with_names` DataFrame is selected and filtered to include only columns `"avg_fare_amount"` and `"Zone"`. The method `select()` is used to select these columns and return a new DataFrame. The `withColumnRenamed()` function is then used to rename the `"avg_fare_amount"` column to `"Zone"`.
# 
# This DataFrame is used as the basis for machine learning modeling where `"avg_fare_amount"` will be used as the feature column and `"Zone"` will be used as the label column. Finally, the resulting DataFrame is displayed using the `display()` function.

# This code performs a groupBy operation on the `'Zone'` column of the DataFrame `'df_ml'` and calculates the average of the `'avg_fare_amount'` column for each group. It then selects only the `'Zone'` and `'avg_fare_amount'` columns and rounds the `'avg_fare_amount'` column to two decimal places using the `'round'` function. The result is a new DataFrame that shows the rounded average fare amount for each zone. The `show()` method is called to display the result in a tabular format.
